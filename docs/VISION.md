# SNPTX Vision

## Mission

SNPTX exists to close the gap between computational discovery and reproducible evidence in biomedical research.

The system provides an orchestration layer that enforces determinism, provenance, and artifact governance across the full machine learning lifecycle — from raw data ingestion through model evaluation to human-readable reporting. It is designed for environments where results must survive peer review, regulatory audit, and multi-institutional collaboration.

## System-Level Intelligence Objective

SNPTX is architected to evolve from a deterministic execution framework into a system capable of structured self-assessment. The long-term objective is not autonomous decision-making, but structured insight synthesis: a system that can identify patterns across its own evaluation outputs, suggest hypotheses for further investigation, and flag anomalies that merit human attention.

This intelligence layer will operate through the same artifact-driven, contract-governed interface as all other extensions. It will not bypass determinism guarantees. It will not automate retraining without explicit authorization. The feedback loop is advisory and auditable by design.

The trajectory is deliberate:

1. **Deterministic execution** — the system produces reliable, reproducible outputs. *(Complete)*
2. **Structured evaluation** — downstream extensions normalize, aggregate, and report on outputs. *(Complete)*
3. **Cross-run synthesis** — the system identifies patterns and anomalies across evaluation histories. *(Planned)*
4. **Hypothesis generation** — structured suggestions emerge from accumulated evidence. *(Planned)*
5. **Closed-loop feedback** — insights flow back into pipeline configuration through governed channels. *(Planned)*

## Infrastructure-First Philosophy

SNPTX prioritizes infrastructure over algorithms. The framework does not compete on model performance — it competes on the reliability, auditability, and governance of the environment in which models are developed, evaluated, and interpreted.

This is a deliberate strategic choice:

- Model architectures change rapidly; infrastructure requirements are stable.
- Reproducibility failures are infrastructure failures, not algorithmic failures.
- Regulatory requirements apply to the process, not to the model.
- Collaboration at scale requires governance, not creativity.

The framework is agnostic to model type, data modality, and analytical methodology. It provides the structural guarantees within which any compliant extension can operate safely.

## Long-Term Direction

![SNPTX Roadmap](assets/SNPTX_Project_roadmap.png)

SNPTX is designed to become the standard orchestration and governance layer for reproducible biomedical ML — the infrastructure that institutions, consortia, and regulatory bodies can trust to produce auditable, deterministic results regardless of the analytical methods deployed within it.
